This is the popt(3) command line option parsing library. While it is similar
to getopt(3), it contains a number of enhancements, including:

	1) popt is fully reentrant
	2) popt can parse arbitrary argv[] style arrays while 
	   getopt(3) makes this quite difficult
	3) popt allows users to alias command line arguments
	4) popt provides convenience functions for parsing strings
	   into argv[] style arrays

Complete documentation on popt(3) is available in popt.pdf (included in this
tarball), which is excerpted with permission from the book "Linux
Application Development" by Michael K. Johnson and Erik Troan (available
from Addison Wesley in May, 1998).
